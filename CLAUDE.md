# Leguitz — notes for Claude

2D top-down pixel-art open-world sandbox (Stardew visuals, Minecraft mechanics). Godot 4.7, GDScript.
The owner speaks French: talk to them in French. Code, identifiers and comments are in English;
player-facing text goes through `i18n/strings.csv` (keys + en + fr), never hard-coded.

## Commands

```bash
bash tools/install_godot.sh --templates desktop && export PATH="$HOME/godot:$PATH"
godot --headless --path . --import                         # required before tests (class cache)
godot --headless --path . -s res://tests/run_tests.gd      # unit tests, exit code 1 on failure
gdlint src tests && gdformat --check src tests             # CI runs both
# Screenshot check (software Vulkan works: apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers xvfb):
xvfb-run -a godot --path . --audio-driver Dummy --resolution 1280x720 -- --seed=42 --debug --screenshot=/tmp/s.png
```

## Architecture rules

- `src/sim` is the authoritative server. It must not depend on nodes, input or rendering.
- The client (`src/client`) only learns about the world via `Msg` dictionaries from a `Transport`,
  and only changes it by sending messages. Keep solo on the same path as future multiplayer.
- World generation must be deterministic per seed: use `HashUtil` (never Godot's `hash()`/`randi()`)
  and derive sub-seeds with `HashUtil.derive_seed(world_seed, SALT)`.
- Tile/block ids are stored in chunks: only append to enums in `src/sim/world/tiles.gd`, never renumber.
- Timed gameplay durations are authored for the default 20-min day and must go through
  `WorldClock.scale_duration()` (pace = clamp((day_minutes/20)^0.25, 0.7, 2.5); synced = 24 h day).
  Only SYNCED worlds catch up offline, capped to one game day.
- Pixel art: 16 px tiles, integer world zoom, UI scaled via the window content scale factor.
  Sprites come from `tools/gen_placeholder_art.py`; its GROUNDS/BLOCKS lists must match the enums.
- World generation (`src/sim/world/generation/`): ClimateSampler (5 Minecraft climate noises,
  sampled every 4 tiles by ClimateGrid) -> TerrainShaper (splines, rivers, terrace levels) ->
  Biomes.select -> SurfaceBuilder (ground + vegetation) ; CaveGenerator for layers -1..-6.
  Chunks are keyed Vector3i(x, y, layer). Tune with `tools/render_world_map.gd` (map PNG + stats).
- generate_chunk() must stay thread-safe (read-only shared state): the server runs it on the
  WorkerThreadPool via ChunkGenerationQueue. Tests use `GameServer.new(settings, null, false)`.
- Add tests in `tests/unit/test_*.gd` (extend `TestCase`, methods named `test_*`).
